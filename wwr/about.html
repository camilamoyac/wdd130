                        class ratings. It's a thrilling way to experience nature, often surrounded by stunning
                        landscapes. Safety gear, including helmets and life jackets, is essential for a safe
                        experience. Join us at The Raft to have the adventure of your life!</p>

                <div class="grid-container">
                    <p>The Colorado River is a 1,450-mile waterway that flows from the Rocky Mountains in Colorado
                        through several states, before reaching Mexico, with iconic landscapes like the Grand
                        Canyon. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, damming projects like the Hoover Dam
                        transformed the river into a crucial source of hydroelectric power and irrigation. Today,
                        the Colorado River faces challenges related to water scarcity and environmental sustainability,
                        making it a key focus for conservation efforts and regionalnegotiations.</p>
